The Priest unties the girdle of the one who is about to be enlightened and divests them of outer clothing and shoes. He stands them facing East, wearing only a tunic, unbelted, bareheaded and unshod, with the hands down. He breathes on their face three times, signs the forehead and breast three times and places his hand on their head as he says the following Prayer:

In your name, Lord God of truth, and that of your Only-Begotten Son and your Holy Spirit, I place my hand on the head of your servant \color{red}N.\color{black}, who has been counted worthy to take refuge in your holy Name and to be guarded under the shelter of your wings. Remove from him/her that ancient error and fill him/her with faith in you, and hope and love, so that he/she may know that you alone are God, true God, and your Only-Begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and your Holy Spirit. Grant that he/she may walk in your commandments and preserve those things that are pleasing to you, for if someone does them, they will live by them. Inscribe him/her in your book of life and unite him/her to the flock of your inheritance. Let your holy Name and that of your beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ and of your life-giving Spirit, be glorified in him/her. Let your eyes remain ever fixed in mercy on him/her, and your ears to hear the voice of his/her supplication. Make him/her glad in the works of his/her hands and in all his/her race, that he/she may confess you, worshipping and glorifying your great and most high Name, and may praise you throughout all the days of his/her life. For every power of heaven sings your praise, and yours is the glory, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.}%
