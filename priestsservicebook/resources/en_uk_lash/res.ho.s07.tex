Protection of Christians that cannot be put to shame, unfailing mediation with the Maker, do not despise the voices of us sinners as we pray; but, in your love, be quick to help us who cry to you with faith: Hasten to intercede, make speed to entreat, O Mother of God, for you ever protect those who honour you.
